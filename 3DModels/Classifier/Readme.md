# Classifier Models

The parts in this folder represent everything that is needed to build the classifier. You will need to print at least one of the caliber specific feed wheels and nozzles as well. 

In the release video, there were a few add-ons which can be found in the Community Folder at the top/root folder in the repo. Those items are linked here as well:
