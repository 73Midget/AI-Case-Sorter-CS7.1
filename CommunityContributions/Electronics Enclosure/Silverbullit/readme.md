Some humble suggestions regarding the 7.1 SCS Electronic box [Swiss Cheeze Submarine] AirFlow variant.

Place supports on;
fan-grill (Wild guess you want thin grill to promote airflow)
overhang on inside top of the fan-pocket

Last but not least, if your slicer does not automatically place supports on the overhangs on the corresponding spots for the latch
(not on the latch itself, but them holy thingies that you stick the pins through to mount the latch)
